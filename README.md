# celegansOF

This is an environment for experimenting with the application of [Beam Fitting](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7521/163f496c807aacf4bc859585839850e303ff.pdf) for skeletonising images of the nematode Celegans.

It's my final year project for my Computer Science Degree at The University of York.

It's built in C++ with openFrameworks 0.9.8
